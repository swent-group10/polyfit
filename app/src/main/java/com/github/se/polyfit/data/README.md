# Package: com.github.se.polyfit.data

This package is responsible for managing the data layer of the application. It contains classes that
interact with various data sources such as Firebase and local databases. These classes are used to
fetch, store, and manipulate data that is used throughout the application.

## Key Components

1. **api**: This package contains classes that interact with external APIs to fetch data. These
   classes are responsible for making network requests and parsing the responses.
2. **local**: This package contains classes that interact with local databases to store and retrieve
   data. These classes use Room database to manage local data storage.
3. **processor**: This package contains classes that process and manipulate data before it is
   displayed to the user. These classes are responsible for transforming raw data into a format that
   can be easily consumed by the UI.
4. **remote**: This package contains classes that interact with remote data sources such as
   Firebase. These classes are responsible for fetching and storing data in the cloud.
5. **repository**: This package contains classes that act as a bridge between the data sources and
   the rest of the application. These classes provide a clean API for fetching and storing data,
   abstracting away the details of the underlying data sources.
