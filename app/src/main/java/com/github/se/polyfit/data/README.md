# Package: `com.github.se.polyfit.data`

This package is responsible for managing the data layer of the application. It contains classes that
interact with various data sources such as Firebase and local databases. These classes are used to
fetch, store, and manipulate data that is used throughout the application. Additionally, it includes
classes that handle API interactions, making network requests and parsing responses.

## Key Components

1. **api**: Classes that interact with external APIs to fetch data. These classes are responsible
   for making network requests and parsing the responses.
2. **local**: Classes that interact with local databases to store and retrieve data. These classes
   use the Room database to manage local data storage.
3. **processor**: Classes that process and manipulate data before it is displayed to the user. These
   classes are responsible for transforming raw data into a format that can be easily consumed by
   the UI.
4. **remote**: Classes that interact with remote data sources such as Firebase. These classes are
   responsible for fetching and storing data in the cloud.
5. **repository**: Classes that act as a bridge between the data sources and the rest of the
   application. These classes provide a clean API for fetching and storing data, abstracting away
   the details of the underlying data sources.
